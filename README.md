# PowerBI
This is a collection of some of the dashboards that I have prepared using PowerBI.
<br>
I have a total 10 years of work experience. For the first 6 years I was working in the field of Compliance operationsand then switched to a data analyst role in 2021. At that time my organization was using AWS Quicksight for creating dashboards. AWS quicksight does not have a dev envoronment like PowerBI Desktop. Hence I was unable to take backup of the works that I had done in quicksight. However when I switched to another organization in 2025, I have started using PowerBI. So, here's a collection of some of the things that I have learnt and created in PowerBI.
